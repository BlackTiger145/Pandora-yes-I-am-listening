This is a simple script for some quality of life features for Pandora.com.
I made a script for my own needs and used for quite some time, and now I publish it to any how needs.
Some of my original features was removed by me becuse they are more personal settings, but the script is fully useable as it is.

## Features
- Auto click the 'I'm here button' to keep playin×¢.
- Track and try to replay your music when the song get stuck.
- Set the tab title to the song name witch is playing.
- Set the site to use shuffle (can be disabled in the code see more in the Installation)

## Installation
- In order to use this script you will need a script add-on to your browser. I use Tampermonkey but fill free to use what you like.
- To disable the shuffle feature just open the script go to the end to 'function inPlayer' andd add // before shuffle(), line 123.
